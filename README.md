Hand Gesture Recognition Model:
This repository contains code for a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data. This enables intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

Overview:
Hand gesture recognition is achieved using deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The model is trained on a dataset of hand gesture images or video frames annotated with corresponding gesture labels.

Key Features:
Gesture Classification: Recognizes and classifies predefined hand gestures.
Real-time Processing: Capable of processing live video streams for real-time interaction.
Flexibility: Easily extendable to recognize new gestures with additional training data.
Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between gestures.

Installation Prerequisites:
Python (version >= 3.6)
TensorFlow (version >= 2.0)
OpenCV (for handling video input)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
